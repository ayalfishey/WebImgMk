# WebImgMk
This program will take a givin image and make a mosaic webpage of that image.
(this is just a small personal project, this is my first dive into CSS)

todo.
  1. make sure it works with any picture size (Needs more testing)
  2. fix the first row colors (Done)
  3. put in comments (Done)
  4. fix the file paths (Done(kinda))
  
  TODO 2:
  1. Make sure to handle bad path input
  2. Make every output file ~the same size no matter the input
  3. Try and find a way to reduce load time. Most likely to be something in css. (Dont know if possible but load pixels by color to cords so you dont double up on loading the same color in a diffrent place)
